Nondisruptive Operations (NDO) are a set of features in NetApp ONTAP that help maintain continuous data availability to clients and hosted applications during planned and unplanned maintenance events.
Volume move is the ability to migrate an online volume from one aggregate to another, including to aggregates on other nodes in the cluster.
You can even move volumes to different types and tiers of storage; for example, moving a volume from SATA to SAS to SSD as its performance needs change.
Volume moves are non-disruptive for all protocols, and ONTAP preserves data protection relationships over a move operation.
NDO does not completely eliminate disruption in all cases, because some stateful protocols like CIFS (depending on which version of SMB the CIFS session is using) do have inherent limitations that make them susceptible to interruption during certain kinds of downtime events.
Most CIFS clients will attempt to reconnect to storage resources after an NDO event.
